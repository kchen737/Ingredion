This report provides\\na high-level overview of our activity under our 2030\\nAll Life sustainability plan, and of the great work our\\nemployees and our business partners engage in across\\nthe globe to enable a more sustainable business and\\na more sustainable world.  \\nOver the past few years, we have seen a growing willingness for collaboration in\\nsustainability, and it is that trend that gives me the most hope for the future. Our\\ncustomers, suppliers, NGO partners and other stakeholders continue to look for\\nways to create shared value that allows us to progress sustainable products and\\npractices that drive a real and positive impact.  \\nI want to call to your attention the title of this year’s report: Create the Future with\\nPeople Who Care. At Ingredion, these are more than just words that we have chosen\\nfor the cover of our report, it is our new employee value proposition. I could think\\nof nothing more fitting for the title of this report, because, more than anything, it is\\nthe passion, dedication and innovation of our employees that drive our sustainability\\nprogress. Whether it’s in the lab working to develop ingredient solutions that help our\\ncustomers meet their product needs, or in the fields where our teams work with growers\\nto help implement climate-resilient practices, our people work to make life better.\\nI take great pride in the progress we continue to make on our All Life plan. We have  \\nA Letter from Our President\\nand Chief Executive Officer  \\nachieved a 22% absolute reduction in our carbon emissions since 2019, and over 85%\\nof our Tier 1 priority crops are now sustainably sourced globally. We have also received\\nexternal recognition for our progress, being named to Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable US\\nCompanies list, as well as the USA Today America’s Climate Leaders list for companies\\ndemonstrating progress against their greenhouse gas reduction targets. Sustainability\\nhas grown increasingly complex over the past few years, but our continued progress and\\nthese recognitions serve as guideposts to indicate that we are on the right path.  \\nLooking to the future, we see innovation as a key enabler for sustainability at Ingredion,\\nwith our customers and in the lives of their consumers. Beyond just developing new\\nfunctional ingredients for our customers, we are broadening our focus on sustainable\\ninnovation to identify where we can be most impactful in supporting a more sustainable\\nworld. While we have kicked off efforts in 2024 to advance our sustainable innovation\\nprogram, we know that will be a long-term commitment that will grow in importance\\ninto the future.  \\nThank you for taking the time to read our sustainability report. I hope that, like me, you\\nare impressed with the great work Ingredion employees around the globe continue to do\\nto support a more sustainable world.  \\n**2024 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT**  \\n#####

\\n**88**  \\n**MATERIALITY MATRIX**  \\n##### Raising our standards by transforming how we look at materiality  \\nEVERYDAY LIFE PLANET LIFE CONNECTED LIFE GOVERNANCE  \\nIn October 2023, Ingredion began the process of moving from a\\ntraditional sustainability materiality assessment to a double materiality\\nassessment that is in line with the requirements of the European\\nUnion’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) double\\nmateriality assessment.* The CSRDs double materiality assessment\\nrequires companies to consider both the financial impact of\\nsustainability issues on their business (financial materiality) and the\\nimpact of their activities on people and the planet (impact materiality).  \\nAcross 2024, we conducted evaluations with internal and external\\nstakeholders, reviewed inputs and outputs with our executive team\\nand engaged consultants to help us navigate the complexity of EU\\nCSRD requirements. Our stakeholder groups include customers,\\nindustry non-government organizations (NGOs), investors and\\nsuppliers. Additionally, we continue to conduct gap assessments\\nagainst standards such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards\\nBoard (SASB), CDP, EcoVadis and Sustainalytics, to name a few.  \\nOur double materiality work will continue into 2025 as we prepare\\nfor anticipated reporting under CSRD in 2028 for 2027 data. We have\\nengaged Deloitte to assist us in this process. We will identify reporting\\nneeds and deploy digital solutions in support of enhanced data\\ngovernance. We also expect to gain further insight on best practices\\nas some companies begin to report on CSRD requirements. It should\\nbe noted that we report on many topics in this report. While some of\\nthem do not rise to the level of materiality to our business, they are\\nthere to help address the information needs of our stakeholders.  \\n*The inclusion of information in this report should not be construed as a characterization or an admission regarding the\\nmateriality or financial impact of that information for purposes of U.S. securities law. For additional information regarding\\nIngredion, please see our current and periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual\\nReports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.  \\n**9**  \\n**Everyday Life**  \\n**10**  \\n**People and Product Safety**  \\n##### Promoting a “Zero” mindset  \\n**2024 Safety Performance**  \\nAt Ingredion, we are vigilant in our pursuit of zero — which\\nmeans zero injuries and zero quality incidents reaching the end\\nconsumer. The zero mindset is an integral part of our culture and\\nis inherent in one of our core values to Care First.  \\nIn 2024, our progress toward zero injuries was mixed. Fortunately,\\nwe did not experience any employee or contractor fatalities. While\\nthe year started with good employee safety performance, we had\\na challenging fourth quarter which resulted in us missing our\\nemployee recordable incident target. One of the challenges with\\nmaintaining the downward year-over-year trend in recordables is\\nour changing workforce, especially in the United States. For 2025,\\nwe are focused on setting clear expectations, along with providing\\nsignificant training and development of new employees.  \\nIngredion had its best year ever with regard to contractor safety\\nperformance. We want all people who enter our facilities to return\\nhome injury-free, regardless if they are employees, contractors or\\nvisitors. We continue to partner with our contractors to complete\\nall work safely. While recordable injury rates are lagging safety\\nindicators, we recognize that focusing on leading indicators and\\nour behavioral-based safety program, Courage to Care, are key\\ninputs to our overall safety program.  \\nTo drive personal accountability throughout the organization,\\nall employees were given a safety observation target, raising\\nthe awareness of safe and unsafe behaviors and conditions.  \\nIn addition, our global manufacturing organization focused\\non capturing Near Misses and taking corrective actions.  \\n**11**  \\nAdditionally, we implemented a standardized, global Environmental, Health,\\nSafety and Sustainability (EHS&S) software program in 2024. It has allowed\\nus to streamline site EHS&S processes and inputs. Hand in hand with those\\nefforts, we are building more robust analytics to understand plant, segment\\nand global trends that inform our continuous improvement activities.  \\n**12**  \\n**Our Continued Commitment**\\n**to Product Quality**  \\nIn 2024, we progressed on multiple initiatives targeted on improving quality and\\nfurther enhancing product safety. Like our safety performance, quality saw highs\\nand lows this year. Product recalls increased compared to 2023 and saw first pass\\ncompliance decrease slightly to 98.38%.  \\nBut despite performance challenges, we launched initiatives in 2024 that\\nwill help drive improved performance in 2025 and beyond. This year saw a\\nconcerted effort to focus on operations and digital transformation, with an eye\\ntoward reducing overall cost of poor quality (COPQ). This included a pilot of\\na new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) at four Ingredion\\nmanufacturing plants. Our LIMS improvements are aimed at standardizing how\\nquality data is collected and communicated across the organization. We also\\nfocused on enhancing our Process Technical Specifications (PTS) to standardize\\nhow our operators conduct tasks.  \\nIn 2024, we also conducted traceability drills that will enable faster response\\ntimes in working internally and with customers, should we have a quality\\nincident that requires it. These type of drills help our employees experience\\na real-world scenario and gain valuable insight that can help save time and\\nreduce impact in the event of an actual issue.  \\nWe have continued to implement our Quality Guardians program\\nglobally, encouraging employees to own quality in all aspects\\nof their job. The program is designed to empower employees to\\ntake immediate action in the event they have a concern about\\nour product manufacturing. Our operators are the front line of\\nquality and the employees that understand how the production\\nprocesses are designed to work. We want to make certain they\\nknow they have the authority to step in when they have a concern.  \\n**13**  \\n**Human Rights**  \\n##### Enhancing transparency of human rights in our supply chain  \\n**Enhancing Our Approach to**\\n**Supply Chain Human Rights**  \\nIn 2024, we made substantial progress in our commitment to human\\nrights and responsible sourcing. At the beginning of the year, we\\nconducted a thorough evaluation of our programs and governance\\nstructures to better address the needs of our customers and supply chain.\\nBased on this assessment, we launched the following initiatives:  \\n**• All Life Partners (ALP) Responsible Sourcing Program**  \\n**• Governance structure for social responsibility audits**\\n**of own operations**  \\n**• Education roadmap for human rights issues**  \\nWe designed and launched our ALP Responsible Sourcing Program,\\naimed at ensuring ethical and sustainable sourcing practices across our\\nsupply chain. The ALP program, in combination with our Supplier Code\\nof Conduct and Ingredion Code of Conduct, illustrates our expectations\\nfor our supply chain. The first two phases of this program focus on our\\nnon-agriculture suppliers who meet high risk criteria, working towards\\nour goal of auditing all suppliers meeting high risk criteria by the end of\\n2027. As of the end of 2024, >50% of suppliers from our first phase were\\naudited, which represents 0.5% of our non-agriculture supply base. It’s\\na promising start, and we have plans to advance and expand the ALP  \\n**14**  \\nWithin our own manufacturing network, we routinely conduct evaluations\\nof human rights risk through the use of independent auditors and the Sedex\\nMember Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 4 pillar methodology. In 2024, we\\ncompleted 21 SMETA 4 pillar audits in the United States, Brazil, Colombia,\\nPakistan, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom, Peru, China, Thailand\\nand Canada. The most common findings were related to working hours,\\nfire alarms and site maintenance. Ingredion takes the results of these\\naudits seriously and works diligently to close non-compliances. As of mid2024, in order to ensure governance and accountability of our human\\nrights program, a monthly status report of our own operations is shared\\nwith our Sustainability leadership team, including our Chief Commercial  \\nIngredion participated in numerous assessments throughout the year, which help us keep\\na pulse on our human rights maturity and guide us towards advanced practices. Ingredion\\nundergoes the EcoVadis assessment annually at a corporate level, which provides a rating\\non our environmental, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement policies,\\npractices and procedures. We increased our overall score from 51 in 2023 to 55 in 2024. The\\nGlobal Child Forum benchmarking assessment allows us to look deeper into our impact on\\nchildren. With an average score for the food and beverage industry of 4.6, Ingredion’s score\\nincreased from 6.9 to 7.5. Our strengths lie in our collaboration with NGOs and our actions\\nto prevent, mitigate and remediate child labor. The Global Child Forum is a non-profit\\norganization dedicated to advancing children’s rights across the world.  \\n**15**  \\n**Advocating for Children’s Rights**  \\nIngredion is dedicated to doing our part to protect the rights of children.\\nWe take deliberate measures to evaluate our own operations and maintain\\nworkplaces operated with respect to human rights. This includes using\\nindustry standards such as the SMETA, which are conducted by accredited\\nthird-party auditors at our manufacturing locations. The evaluation of\\nchildren’s rights across our value chain poses a greater challenge. And\\nwhile we have not identified any issues of child labor, we recognize that the\\ngreatest potential risk comes through parts of our agricultural supply chain.  \\nOver the past few years, we have worked to strengthen our practices in\\nprotecting children’s rights. A valuable partner in this journey has been the\\nGlobal Child Forum, an organization that evaluates companies’ performances\\nand provides insightful feedback on alignment with leading practices in\\nour industry. While we are pleased with our performance in 2024, we\\nwill continue to use the Global Child Forum feedback to assess additional  \\nopportunities for improvement.  \\n**Human Rights in Our**\\n**Agricultural Supply Chains**  \\nIngredion remains committed to using the Sustainable Agriculture\\nInitiative (SAI) Platform’s Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) to\\nevaluate the sustainability practices of the growers in our supply\\nchain. This enables us to collect information on a variety of\\nfarm-level practices, including labor and safety practices. In 2024,\\nwe expanded our use of the FSA to over 85% of our Tier 1 priority\\ncrops (i.e. corn, tapioca, potato, stevia and pulses/peas), which\\nrepresent approximately 99% of our global sourcing by volume. The\\nFSA is comprised of 109 questions, with 23 labeled as Essential, and\\na negative response from the grower automatically disqualifies the\\nfarm from meeting FSA sustainable sourcing requirements. These\\nEssential questions cover a variety of topics, such as no forced labor\\n(FSA77) and no child labor (FSA96), which help us evaluate the\\nhuman rights practices of our growers.  \\nIn 2024, 85% of the Tier 1 priority crop growers in our supply\\nchain met the SAI Platform FSA Bronze level or higher,\\nmeaning that “Essential” labor and human rights\\npractices are all in place. In select instances or\\ngeographies, we have chosen to evaluate part\\nof our agricultural supply chain beyond the FSA.\\nFor example, we conducted a human rights\\nassessment across our stevia supply chain to\\nvalidate ethical practices are in place.  \\nMore information on Ingredion programs with\\nour agricultural suppliers can be found in the\\n_Sustainable and Regenerative Agriculture_\\nsection of this report.  \\n**16**  \\n**Enhancements to**\\n**the SMETA Process** **Focus on Paying a Living Wage**  \\nTo continue to drive excellence in our Sedex Member Ethical Trade  \\nAudit (SMETA) process, we implemented additional initiatives in\\n2024. First among these was improved training around human rights\\nrequirements with employees in applicable functional areas, such as\\nmanufacturing, human resources and procurement. This training not\\nonly reiterates our requirements with key personnel, but also helps\\nthem identify potential risks with our supply chain partners.  \\nAnother enhancement implemented was our SMETA finding tracking\\nprocess. While the Sedex platform itself offers a mechanism for\\nclosing our audit findings, we wanted a system that would enable\\nus to better track multiple actions under findings, as well as enable\\ntrending across plants and regions to drive holistic, company-wide\\nimprovements.  \\nAcross 2024 we saw some additional requests from customers\\nfor semi-announced audits, though there is variance from these\\ncustomers in what meets the requirement for “semi-announced.”\\nWe will continue to work with our customers, industry groups and\\nour audit providers to align on industry needs and begin to\\nimplement processes accordingly in our auditing program.  \\nIngredion knows well that our employees are the foundation of a strong company. Therefore,\\nit is vital we continue to assess employee compensation to make certain those employees can\\nmaintain a standard of living. In 2024, we started the process of evaluating our global operations\\nagainst living wage standards. While there is not a single industry-adopted standard around what\\nconstitutes a living wage, we have started our evaluation based on input from stakeholders.\\nWe look to continue this work across 2025 and beyond, evaluating the compensation of our\\nemployees and how this enables quality of life.  \\n**Human Rights**\\n**Program Pillars**  \\nOur Human Rights Program is designed to uphold and promote\\nhuman rights across all aspects of our operations. The program\\nis built on four key pillars:  \\n**01** **02** **03** **04**  \\n**17**  \\n**Inclusion and Belonging**  \\n##### Living our core values  \\n**How We Cultivate a Culture of Care**  \\nAt the heart of our people-centric culture are two\\nof our core values: “Everyone Belongs” and “Care\\nFirst.” This means cultivating an environment where\\nevery person feels valued, respected, included and\\nsupported by a community of talented, caring people.  \\nThese principles are essential to achieving our\\nbusiness performance and growth. In 2024 we\\nstrengthened our focus by evolving to our new\\nInclusion and Belonging program. This better aligns\\nwith our core values and empowers us to cultivate\\na culture and workplace that unlocks innovation,\\nenhances problem-solving and drives performance.  \\nAt Ingredion, our goal is to have a workplace where\\nyou can “create the future with people who care,” and\\npursue experiences that build a rewarding career. We\\ndo this by offering flexibility through our Engagement\\nframework, comprehensive benefit packages and\\nresources to support employee development, learning\\nand well-being. Our approach focuses on promoting\\nand protecting the whole person under the pillars of\\nfinancial, mental/emotional, physical and social.\\nLast year, we refined our global giving priorities\\nto align with our refreshed winning aspiration. I’m\\nextremely proud to have personally volunteered in\\nsome of the community impact events. Globally, our\\nemployees mobilized to give their time and resources\\nto local and global organizations and communities\\nsupporting organizations from food banks to Science,  \\nTechnology, Engineering, Math (STEM) education.\\nIt is our employees who care and come together to\\nmake a collective difference year\\nafter year.  \\nJust as we diversify our ingredient solutions to\\nremain competitive, we recognize that our global\\nworkforce and customers are diverse. We have the  \\nresponsibility to respect human rights throughout\\nour business and continue to build a more inclusive  \\nculture that supports individual growth and propels\\nour collective organizational success.  \\nAs you read through this report, the evolution of\\nour Inclusion and Belonging journey is reflected.\\nOur maturity along with the engagement of\\nour employees and Business Resource Groups\\nshowcases the company we strive to be every day.\\nTogether, we have the power to create a better\\ntomorrow and positively impact the future.  \\n**18**  \\n**Our Aspirational Goals**  \\nOur organizational commitment to fostering an inclusive work environment that\\nembraces diversity, and each person is valued and feels inspired to contribute their\\nbest remains unchanged. To achieve this, we have set three aspirational goals:  \\n**Building Our Strategy On**\\n**Three Strategic Pillars**  \\nHow can we cultivate a culture of care and empowerment? Our strategy\\nis built on three strategic pillars: Workforce Representation, Workplace\\nBelonging and Strategic Partnerships. Each pillar guides our strategic\\ndecisions and collectively helps us cultivate the culture that defines our  \\ncompany.  \\nWe are committed to fostering diverse talent and an inclusive culture by\\ncreating timely and appropriate opportunities that enable our employees\\nto excel in their roles. The information presented in this report provides\\na clear view of the areas where we have made significant progress,\\nas well as those that still need improvement.  \\n**19**  \\nFocusing on the composition of our workforce, we strive to ensure that we are representative of the communities where\\nwe operate and enable enhanced performance throughout. Our workforce representation data adheres to the Global\\nReporting Initiative (GRI) standards, providing a comprehensive and transparent view of our efforts to maintain inclusion\\nand belonging within our organization.  \\nAge Groups (ALL LEVELS) Tenure Groups (ALL LEVELS) Racial and Ethnic  \\n**14.8%** Representation  \\n**21.9%** **Under 30** **18.4%** **41.4%**  \\nTenure Groups  \\n(ALL LEVELS)  \\n**14.8%**\\n**Under 30** **18.4%** **41.4%**\\n**years old**  \\nManufacturing\\nRepresentation  \\n(ALL LEVELS)  \\nTHE WORKFORCE REPRESENTATION DATA  \\nUSES GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE (GRI)  \\nSTANDARDS.  \\n**19.7%**\\n**2+ to 5 years**  \\n**63.3%**\\n**30-50 years old**  \\n**20.5%**\\n**5+ to 10 years**  \\n**Workforce**\\n**Belonging**  \\nGLOBAL INCLUSION WEEK  \\nIn 2023, we celebrated Global Inclusion Week (GIW), an initiative designed on insights from our\\nemployee engagement surveys. We identified key areas for improvement and defined topics\\nfor the week accordingly. We provided a global framework, allowing each region to tailor the\\nevent to their specific needs. For instance, our US/CAN region focused on collaboration within\\nour communities and entrepreneurs, while our APAC team emphasized intergenerational\\ncollaboration.  \\nOver the past two years, GIW has seen record attendance, and we are excited to host our\\nthird year this summer. This event is activated across all our locations and involves over 200\\nemployees in the planning team globally. The week is dedicated to highlighting our core value of\\n“Everyone Belongs,” and it’s a time to spotlight this value and see it truly come to life globally.\\nEmployees from all regions participated in virtual sessions, encouraging everyone to take action\\ntowards creating a more inclusive environment.  \\nBUSINESS RESOURCE GROUP (BRG)\\nMENTORING PROGRAM  \\nWe believe in equity and providing mentoring opportunities to enhance\\nperformance to those who seek them. That’s why we launched the BRG\\nmentoring program, open to all employees, in 2023. After a successful\\npilot, we continued the program in 2024. With a total of 273 participants,\\nthe program fostered meaningful connections and facilitated valuable\\nknowledge exchange.  \\nFeedback from program participants was overwhelmingly positive, with\\nmentees rating the experience at an impressive 9 out of 10. The program’s\\nsuccess can be attributed to its structured approach, including monthly\\ntouchpoints that ensure consistent engagement and progress. Both\\nmentors and mentees benefited from comprehensive mentoring guides,\\nproviding valuable insights and best practices.  \\nAs we look ahead, we are excited to continue this impactful initiative,\\nwelcoming a new cohort of participants in the spring of 2025.  \\n**21**  \\n**Pay Parity**\\n**Statement**  \\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO EQUAL PAY FOR\\nEQUAL WORK, REGARDLESS OF GENDER,\\nRACE, ETHNICITY OR OTHER PERSONAL\\nCHARACTERISTICS.  \\nTo deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based\\non local market data and consider various factors, such as an employee’s\\nrole and experience, job location and performance when establishing\\nindividual pay levels. We regularly review our compensation practices\\nto promote fair and equitable pay. Additionally, in 2024 we conducted\\na pay equity analysis to identify any pay gaps across our organization.\\nBased on our analysis, _we identified no systemic issues or negative_\\n_pay gaps between male and female employees_ . Similarly, in the United\\nStates, we found no systemic issues or negative pay gaps across different\\nracial/ethnic groups.  \\nWe believe providing a holistic total rewards package contributes\\nto a valuable employee experience and helps us attract and retain\\nemployees. Underpinned by our Care First value, we provide access\\nto medical, welfare and retirement benefits and offer programs to all\\nemployees that support overall well-being, including paid parental leave\\nand caregiver leave, as well as financial, physical and mental health\\nresources. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees’\\nhealth and wellness needs.  \\n**Business Resource Groups (BRG)**\\n**Continue To Grow**  \\nAs a key element of our Inclusion and Belonging strategy, our BRGs grew and\\nexpanded throughout 2024. BRG membership now encompasses 22.5% of our\\nglobal workforce. Our nine BRGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that unite\\nindividuals with shared identities, interests and experiences, all aiming to enrich\\nIngredion’s culture and performance. These groups are open and inclusive to\\nALL employees.  \\nIn the same year, we proudly hosted our fourth BRG Leadership Forum. This\\nevent not only featured best practices from industry experts, but also provided\\nvaluable resources to enhance leadership skills and foster professional\\nnetworking opportunities.  \\n**22**  \\n**Business Resource Group (BRG)**\\n**Regional Leadership Program**  \\nDeveloping our BRG regional leaders is crucial for\\nfostering a culture of inclusivity and excellence\\nwithin our organization. These leaders play a\\npivotal role in shaping our workplace environment,\\nensuring that it is welcoming and supportive\\nfor everyone. To continue our commitment to\\ninclusivity and support the growth of our leaders,\\nwe have formalized a comprehensive leadership\\ndevelopment program. This program covers\\nessential topics such as stakeholder engagement  \\n**Founded**\\n###### **2017**  \\nand influencing up, project management,\\nbuilding talent and teams and strategic thinking.\\nBy equipping our leaders with these skills, we\\nempower them to drive positive change and\\ninspire others. This intentional investment in their\\ndevelopment is a recognition of their vital role in\\nour organization. By nurturing their leadership\\ncapabilities, we not only enhance their personal\\ngrowth, but also strengthen our collective ability\\nto create a more inclusive and dynamic workplace.  \\n**Founded** **Founded** **Founded**\\n###### **2019 2021 2022**  \\n###### **2021**  \\n**Founded**  \\n**Founded**  \\n###### **2022**  \\nMEMBERS: 392 MEMBERS: 803 MEMBERS: 253 MEMBERS: 133  \\nMEMBERS: 1036 MEMBERS: 260 MEMBERS: 271 MEMBERS: 183  \\nMEMBERS: 1163  \\n**23**  \\n**Business Connection** **Focus on Psychological Safety**  \\nOur Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are integral to driving business\\nconnections and fostering a culture of inclusivity and growth. As the name\\nsuggests, BRGs are deeply involved in various business initiatives, including\\nuniversity recruiting where they play a key role in driving our buddy\\nprogram. This program helps new recruits integrate smoothly into our\\norganization, ensuring they feel supported from day one.  \\nAdditionally, BRGs collaborate with customers to strengthen relationships\\nand enhance mutual understanding. They also contribute to the ongoing\\neducational journey in Inclusion and Belonging by sharing dynamic\\nlearning opportunities tailored for our manufacturing employees.\\nFurthermore, BRGs are instrumental in changing the industry from\\nwithin, particularly by encouraging and supporting women in\\nmanufacturing. Their efforts not only promote diversity, but\\nalso drive innovation and excellence across our organization.  \\nThis year, we made a deliberate effort to prioritize psychological safety\\nin our training programs. Psychological safety refers to an environment\\nwhere individuals feel safe to express their thoughts, ask questions and\\ntake risks without fear of negative consequences. It is closely connected\\nto inclusion, as it fosters a culture where everyone feels valued and\\nrespected, enabling diverse perspectives to be shared openly.  \\nWe focused on delivering this crucial education to all people managers\\nin our manufacturing sector across the US, integrating it into other\\ndevelopment programs to ensure a comprehensive approach. Looking\\nahead, we plan to expand this initiative to other regions in 2025,\\nreinforcing our commitment to creating a psychologically safe and\\ninclusive workplace for all.  \\n**Strategic Partnerships**  \\nAt Ingredion, making a positive impact in the communities where we operate\\nis a crucial aspect of our Inclusion and Belonging (I&B) journey. We are committed\\nto forming strategic partnerships with key organizations. Below are a few we’d\\nlike to highlight:  \\nDedicated to\\nSociety of Women Engineers (SWE):\\nempowering women in engineering & technology. In 2024, Ingredion had\\nthe unique opportunity to present “From Comfort Zone to Career Zone” at\\ntheir annual national conference.  \\nFocused on\\nAmerican Corporate Partners (ACP):\\nhelping returning-Veterans and active-duty spouses find their next careers\\nthrough 1:1 mentoring, networking and online career advice. Ingredion\\nhas participated in the mentoring program for the last three years.  \\nFor the third\\nInstitute of Food Technology (IFT):\\nyear in a row, Ingredion has established an I&B-specific partnership\\nsharing best practices and frameworks to remove barriers for\\nhistorically excluded talent in the food science industry.  \\nLEAD Network: Since 2021 Ingredion has partnered\\nwith the LEAD network and has attended their annual conference  \\nthe last two years to help drive inclusion in the European retail\\nand consumer packaged (CPG) industries.  \\nOut and Equal: Since 2022 Ingredion has partnered\\nwith Out and Equal to create inclusive workplaces.  \\nASCEND: Supports and develops business leaders of\\ntomorrow. Ingredion has partnered for the last 2 years.  \\n**25**  \\n**Innovation**  \\n##### Prioritizing sustainable innovation  \\n**Embracing Novel Solutions to**\\n**Increase Sustainability**  \\nWe know that innovation holds tremendous potential to help Ingredion,\\nour customers and our other supply chain partners reach their\\nsustainability goals. It’s not just product innovation, but examining\\nevery angle of our operation to increase sustainability. This could be\\nnew ways of approaching project financing, like co-sharing costs with\\nour partners on regenerative agriculture initiatives, or digging into the\\ndetails at a micro level. For example, a technology like mobile phone\\napps is not cutting-edge, but has enabled us to work more closely with\\nsmall holder farmers in geographies like Thailand.  \\nAcross this year we have seen that reformulating for sustainability is\\na growing focus for our customers. The sustainability value is often\\nbundled in with other benefits, like affordability. For example, Ingredion\\nmakes a functional starch that helps our paper customers use higher\\npercentages of recycled content in their end product. This not only\\nhelps them reduce costs by reducing virgin content in their product,\\nbut it also helps reduce their product water and carbon footprint. Our\\ninnovation expertise, along with tools such as the HowGood product\\nsustainability platform and our proprietary ATLAS consumer insights\\ndatabase, make us a valuable resource for customers looking to change\\nproduct formulations or create entirely new products for launch. With\\nover 11 years of consumer research and insight, ATLAS provides us with\\na unique market view to better support our customers.  \\n**26**  \\n**Redefining Sustainable Innovation**  \\nThis year, we undertook a study with an outside consultant to evaluate our work in sustainable\\ninnovation. The study was completed in September and highlighted a few key findings. It\\nconfirmed that sustainability is increasing as a driver for growth in the food and beverage\\nindustry, showed us where the best business case for sustainable innovation lies, identified our\\ncurrent strengths and explored additional opportunities for our consideration. This report laid\\nthe foundation for additional work being done to redefine our sustainable innovation strategy.  \\nIn 2024, we kicked off those efforts to update our sustainable innovation strategy, putting\\ntogether a multifunctional team that included leaders from innovation, plant science, supply\\nchain and sustainability. As part of our All Life plan, we have a goal of linking new product\\ndevelopment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby also linking to\\nopportunities for growth in our industry. But our new work around sustainable innovation\\nis looking beyond product development, examining opportunities to innovate all along our\\nsupply chain. From crop seeds to operational processes to end product use by customers\\nand consumers, this expanded scope will help us identify opportunities for sustainable value\\ncreation, particularly ones that might not lie directly within our own business.  \\nFor example, consider a starch that could have a slightly higher carbon\\nfootprint to manufacture, but enables our customers to replace up to\\n50% of egg whites in their formulations, which dramatically lowers the\\ncarbon footprint of the end consumer good. This thinking is critical for\\nour development, as processing of goods sold represents the highest\\npercentage of Ingredion’s Scope 3 emissions, and, therefore, the biggest\\nopportunity for us to drive improvement as a lead in plant-based ingredients.  \\n**27**  \\n**Increasing Our Collaboration** **Making Healthy Taste Better**\\n**with HowGood**\\nAt Ingredion, we know that textures are integral to an exceptional eating\\nexperience. Whether it’s the satisfying crunch of fried chicken, the perfect  \\nIn 2022, we announced our partnership with HowGood, the world’s largest\\nproduct sustainability database. As the first major ingredient company to stretch of mochi or the indulgent creaminess of yogurt, textures play an  \\nimportant role in consumer enjoyment.  \\n**Making Healthy Taste Better**  \\nIn 2022, we announced our partnership with HowGood, the world’s largest\\nproduct sustainability database. As the first major ingredient company to\\npartner with them, we wanted to make certain their Latis platform worked\\nas well for ingredients as it does for finished consumer goods. We started\\nby piloting 50 products in the system, working closely with the HowGood\\nteam to evaluate the results and understand where additional data input\\nwas needed.  \\nA few short years later, we\\ncould not have imagined how\\nmuch the platform would be\\nused by Ingredion to evaluate\\ncustomer formulations, assess\\nhow new products align with the\\nUN Sustainable Development\\nGoals, determine product carbon\\nfootprint and deliver many other\\nvalue-added benefits. So in\\n2024, Ingredion expanded our\\ncollaboration with HowGood  \\nbeyond the pilot program,\\nenabling us to put all of the\\nproducts we manufacture into\\nthe Latis platform.  \\nFurther highlighting texture’s impact on product appeal, our research shows\\nthat the majority of consumers will not eat a food if they dislike the texture.  \\nWe are proud to work with our customers as they face a growing challenge\\nof creating products that not only fulfill the need for convenience, but also\\ndelivers satisfying textures and flavors while meeting consumers’ expectations\\nfor healthful and convenient food and beverages. Our experts can formulate\\nfor healthier eating without compromising the overall satisfaction of the\\neating experience.  \\nSimply put, we help customers Master the Texture Equation [SM] to deliver\\nsuperior products that drive consumer preference.  \\n**To learn more, visit The Texture Equation** **[SM]**  \\n**28**  \\n**Sustainable Packaging/Industrial**  \\nWe continue to see a growing trend in consumer desires for clean\\nlabel products, or products that are made using less chemicals. It also\\nstands to reason that consumers will want their food to be sold or  \\ndelivered in packaging that is chemical-free. The packaging industry\\nhas historically relied on PFAS – or forever chemicals – to provide oil\\nand grease resistance. But plant-based coatings offer a safe, highperforming alternative that addresses consumer demand. These\\nplant-based ingredients can be made from crops like tapioca and corn,\\nwhich Ingredion responsibly sources under the Sustainable Agriculture\\nInitiative (SAI) Platform’s Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA). To\\nlearn more about our sustainable agriculture program, please see the\\n_Sustainable and Regenerative Agriculture_ section of this report.  \\nInnovative new products like our CORAGUM [®] LS\\n3147 provides a “one bag” innovative solution for\\nour corrugated manufacturing customers. This\\ningredient enables high-performance packaging\\nmanufacturers to increase speed and productivity,\\nwhile reducing starch, chemicals and liquid\\nadhesive consumption. This is but one example\\nof how we are bringing technology to packaging\\ncustomers to help them improve performance\\nwhile reducing their environmental impact.  \\n**29**  \\n**Finding New Pathways** **Deepening Our Commitment**\\n**to Innovation** **to Animal Welfare**  \\nWe know that sustainability comes in many forms at many points along\\nour supply chain. This may be in plant science related to the seeds\\nused for crop production, or in working with suppliers to understand\\ntechnology or solutions that they can provide for our business.  \\n_A highlight:_ Our Brazil business launched a supplier innovation program\\nin late 2024. This program was designed to highlight the innovative work\\nof our suppliers as well as identify solutions that we may not be aware\\nof. The program highlights how the local team in Brazil is expanding the\\nscope of innovation, looking beyond products to find additional value in\\nour supply chain.  \\nIngredion remains committed to our animal welfare policy, which\\nrestricts animal testing of our products to only those instances where\\nit is required by applicable law. Our Animal Welfare Council – a\\nmulti-functional team representing innovation, regulatory, legal and\\nsustainability – continues to meet on a quarterly basis to review our\\npractices and make certain they remain in accordance with our policy.  \\n**Planet Life**  \\n**31**  \\n**Environmental Impact**  \\n##### Working to reduce the environmental impact of our operations  \\n**Committed to Finding Win-Win**\\n**Environmental Solutions**  \\nIn 2024, we continued making headway toward our Environmental Impact\\ncommitments. Increases in renewable purchased electricity and finding\\nfurther beneficial uses for our solid waste demonstrate how we are working\\nto meet our goals and create a more sustainable business. As we continue\\nto drive progress, we are also seeing growing and evolving external\\nattention in environmental performance. Stakeholders have expressed\\ninterest in understanding our carbon transition plan, and a growing\\nnumber of customers would like to understand how our products and\\noperations affect their own carbon reduction plans. At the heart of it all,\\nwe are committed to identifying and implementing innovative, economical\\nsolutions that protect the environment across our global business.  \\n**32**  \\n**Building a Carbon Reduction Strategy:**\\n**Our Climate Transition Plan**  \\nclimate transition plan to our well-below 2 0c target in our 2023 Sustainability  \\nincluded an update on this plan in this year’s report as well.  \\nOur Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions versus 2023 were similar. The energy mix in\\nsome sites changed compared to the prior year, but the net global impact was\\nneutral. For example, our two new renewable biomass boilers in Mogi Guaçu and\\nBalsa Nova, Brazil, ran for the full 12-month period. In addition, we increased our\\nrenewable electricity to approximately 32% purchased globally with the largest\\nyear-over-year increase occurring in Brazil. We also started up on-site solar\\ngeneration at our Ban Kao Dihn and Kalasin, Thailand, sites in 2024. However, in\\nour Cornwala, Pakistan, plant, the energy economics favored coal cogeneration\\nfor the full year.  \\nThe Mogi Guaçu and Balsa Nova  \\nand the Brazil biomass boilers.  \\n**33**  \\nLEVER: **Optimize Energy Consumption**  \\n**01**  \\n**02**  \\nINGREDION PERFORMANCE SYSTEM (IPS) is the\\nimplementation of standard tools and routines for operations processes that apply\\nbest practices to enable continuous improvement of our operation leading to energy,\\nwater and waste optimization. IPS implementation is progressing across our global\\nsites to become our standard way of working.  \\nENERGY EFFICIENCY CAPEX INVESTMENT is deploying our\\ncapital resources to improve existing plant equipment energy efficiency leading to\\nfinancial cost savings and energy consumption reductions.  \\n**03**  \\nNETWORK OPTIMIZATION is routinely\\nperformed by our Global Operations team, which aims to\\noptimally produce products in our global asset network\\nto satisfy our customers’ requirements with a high level\\nof service. As part of our cost-to-compete initiative, we\\npreviously announced the cessation of operations at two\\nsmaller facilities in Brazil and Canada, as well as Goole, United\\nKingdom operation. These network changes will be realized in\\n2025, and the overall GHG impact is expected to be relatively\\nsmall compared to Ingredion’s global GHG footprint.  \\nLEVER: **Substitute Energy Sources**  \\n**04**  \\nCOAL CONVERSION has been a significant\\ndecarbonization lever for Ingredion. In 2021, Ingredion\\nfinalized efforts to exit coal used in our boilers at our Argo\\nfacility – the largest manufacturing plant globally for the\\ncompany. In the United States, our Winston Salem, North\\nCarolina site also utilizes a small percentage of coal in its\\nenergy mix, and we have a project that will be completed in\\n2025 to transition this small portion to natural gas, reducing\\nthe site’s carbon footprint by approximately 5,000 MT CO2.\\nWhen this investment is complete, Ingredion’s Americas\\noperations will be coal-free.  \\nWe have developed a robust global pipeline of capital projects with sustainability\\nbenefits following plant-specific energy studies with third-party energy experts.\\nIngredion is exploring AI digital use cases to optimize asset performance as well,\\nand we will continue to build capability in areas such as energy and water\\noptimization. We continue to prioritize these investments based\\non available resources.  \\nEnergy efficient solutions can come in many forms.\\n_An example:_ We made an investment at our Argo,\\nIllinois, plant to more efficiently operate the natural\\ngas boiler following the conversion from coal a\\nfew years ago. This enabled the plant to reduce\\nan estimated 19,000 metric tons (MT) of CO2  \\nper year.  \\n**34**  \\n**05**  \\n**06**  \\nBIOMASS ENERGY has been utilized in new renewable biomass  \\nboiler investments in three Brazilian locations since 2019, which has\\nenabled Ingredion to reduce its carbon footprint through the transition\\nto renewable sources.  \\nRENEWABLE ELECTRICITY provides a substantial lever\\nto decarbonize our global carbon footprint. The economic cost of\\nrenewable electricity varies by market based on local supply and demand.\\nThere is relative cost parity in some markets, and in those cases, we\\nhave prioritized renewable electricity purchases from the grid. In 2023,\\nwe participated in a project to explore a US virtual power purchasing\\nagreement (VPPA) with an external consultant and other supply chain\\npartners. Upon analysis, we concluded that the current US VPPA agreement\\nstructures would increase Ingredion’s earnings volatility and add\\nincremental energy cost. It is extremely difficult to pass this incremental\\ncost to our customers, who are looking for cost-effective solutions in\\ntheir formulations. As a result, we concluded to not pursue the VPPA\\nagreement. We continue to monitor the market for more economic\\nopportunities in the future.  \\nWe continue to evaluate solar power solutions at our manufacturing\\nsites, looking for solutions that provide renewable green power. Given\\nthe physical on-site surfaces available (e.g. available land, rooftops), the\\nsolution can often be a smaller percentage of the site’s overall electricity\\nconsumption. We have progressed on-site solar installations in Colombia,\\nThailand and Pakistan, which have had attractive capacity generation\\nand financial returns. Two on-site solar installations in Thailand started\\noperations in 2024.  \\n**35**  \\n**07** ZERO/LOW CARBON FUELS, such as renewable natural gas and **08**  \\ngreen hydrogen, provide a significant future opportunity to reduce carbon emissions\\nin processes that have traditionally consumed natural gas. Natural gas is the primary\\nfuel utilized in our global manufacturing sites. Our procurement team continues\\nto scout for suppliers with the capability to provide renewable natural gas at cost\\nparity to conventional natural gas. Our customers are focusing on cost competitive\\ningredient formulations, and maintaining a competitive cost is an important\\nconsideration for them. Green hydrogen is a potential long-term solution, and we\\ncontinue to monitor technology opportunities for it to become cost competitive.  \\nELECTRIC VEHICLES present a very low magnitude\\nimpact for Ingredion’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions because our\\nsupply chain model almost exclusively includes third-party\\ntransportation suppliers. The majority of our transportationrelated emissions are reported in Scope 3. Ingredion only has\\na small number of leased vehicles for employee transportation\\nglobally, and our procurement team is working with local\\nvendors to evaluate options along with electrical charging\\ninfrastructure requirements.  \\nA portion of our sites utilize anaerobic wastewater treatment processes, which\\nproduce biogas, a sustainable option to conventional natural gas. In our Kalasin,\\nThailand, facility, we invested in biogas storage infrastructure to enable our site to\\nconsume all biogas produced locally.  \\nproduce biogas, a sustainable option to conventional natural gas. In our Kalasin, **09** PROCESS ELECTRIFICATION, when coupled  \\nwith renewable electricity, also creates a pathway for  \\nThailand, facility, we invested in biogas storage infrastructure to enable our site to  \\ncarbon emissions reductions. Deployment of this pathway  \\nconsume all biogas produced locally.  \\nis best suited for greenfield builds, plant expansions or the\\nreplacement of obsolete equipment. We continue to evaluate\\nnew technologies that could be applied to our process as\\nan economic alternative to conventional natural gas fueled\\nequipment.  \\n**09**  \\n**36**  \\nLEVER: **Capture CO2**  \\n**10**  \\nCARBON CAPTURE, SEQUESTRATION\\nAND UTILIZATION technologies have been evaluated for\\nIngredion’s corn wet milling processes with a third-party consultant.\\nThe flue gas streams from our corn wet mill operations that are\\npotential targets for carbon capture possess a relatively low CO2\\nconcentration compared to other processes, such as fermentation\\nthat produce a high concentration CO2 stream. The low CO2\\nconcentration stream impacts the economic feasibility of utilizing\\nthe current carbon capture technology available, but we continue\\nto monitor the technological advances in this area.  \\nLEVER: **Offset**  \\n**11**  \\nPURCHASED OFFSETS are not a priority for Ingredion at\\nthis time because we have prioritized reducing our physical emissions\\nin our operation.  \\nIngredion’s existing STBi Scopes 1 and 2 GHG reduction goal aligns with\\nWell-below 2 0 C and the Paris Agreement. We remain focused on trying to\\nidentify a pathway to a Scope 1 and 2 SBTi 1.5 0 C target, which is required before\\nwe can have a validated Net Zero target as well. We believe that the SBTi\\nmethodology establishes criteria aligned with our own beliefs that reducing\\nphysical emissions in our value chain is essential to mitigating climate change.  \\n**37**  \\nCATEGORIES **Purchased Goods and Services**  \\n**01**  \\nSUSTAINABLE AND REGENERATIVE\\nAGRICULTURE is a foundational component of Ingredion’s\\nAll Life Sustainability strategy. In 2024, we achieved approximately\\n85% of our Tier 1 crops (corn, tapioca, potato, stevia, pulses) as\\nsustainably sourced.  \\n**02**  \\nSUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT related to GHG emissions reductions  \\nassociated with the materials we purchase is an important lever for reducing\\nour Scope 3 emissions. We have completed a supplier segmentation to better\\nunderstand which suppliers are estimated to be the highest contributors\\nto Ingredion’s Scope 3 emissions on a spend-based analysis. In 2024, we\\nevaluated several software vendors with solutions for Scope 3 calculations and\\nsupplier engagement. System implementation will start in 2025, and we look\\nforward to scalable supplier data collection and engagement being enabled by\\nthis new capability.  \\nMODE AND LOGISTICS OPTIMIZATION are avenues  \\nto optimize our carbon footprint and delivery costs. Air freight is an extremely\\ncarbon-intensive form of transportation compared to other modes (e.g. truck,\\nrail, ocean). Our Global Supply Chain team leads a Sales and Operations\\nPlanning process that aims to accurately forecast customer demand and\\noptimize production globally to meet on-time customer deliveries. In 2024,\\nthe global spend on air freight was minimal, and does not provide a significant\\ncurrent opportunity to reduce emissions. Our Global Supply Chain team is also\\nworking to deploy technologies and processes to optimize loads and routings.  \\nALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUELS, such as\\nadvanced biofuels for ocean freight or electric truck transportation, are in their\\nearly stages of adoption. We have piloted electric trucks in Brazil and China\\nwhere the routes align with this technology and its current cost and range. Our\\nprocurement team continues to work with potential vendors to identify viable\\nuse cases to pilot this technology.  \\nIn our grower engagements, we work with farmers to collect\\nfarm-level information related to issues such as fertilizer use in  \\napplications like the Cool Farm Tool. Through our partnership with\\nHowGood, we are evaluating integration of on-farm sustainability\\ndata with our global GHG reporting using their new FieldScope tool.  \\nIn 2024, we focused on improving the quality of our FLAG (forest,\\nland and agriculture) Scope 3 calculations. We transitioned to using\\nHowGood emissions data for agriculture raw materials, such as corn,\\ntapioca, and stevia, that comprehensively include farm-to-farm gate\\nemissions, land use change and carbon removals estimates.  \\n**03**  \\n**04**  \\n**38**  \\nCATEGORIES **Processing of Sold Product**  \\n**05**  \\nCUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT related to the GHG emissions associated  \\nwith the process of our product in their facility has not yet started. We aim to\\nbegin the initial engagement process with our customers with similar sustainability\\nobjectives as Ingredion. This will enable further product collaborations related to\\nGHG reductions and primary data that can be utilized in our Scope 3 calculations.  \\n**Making Significant Strides Toward**\\n**Our Renewable Energy Commitment**  \\nAs indicated in our carbon transition plan, renewable energy plays a strategic role in our global\\ncarbon reduction strategy. 2024 saw our renewable electricity increase to approximately 32%\\nof our global purchased electricity, with the largest year-over-year increases occurring in our\\nLATAM segments. In addition to purchased electricity, we also expanded our use of on-site\\nrenewable energy throughout the year. We commissioned floating and land solar panels at two\\nfacilities in Thailand, and these join existing renewable electricity infrastructure in Colombia\\nand Pakistan. We also had a full year of operations at our two biomass plants in Brazil with our\\npartner ComBio.  \\n**Maintaining Water Stewardship**\\n**Across Our Operations**  \\nWater is a critical resource for our operations, and we are\\ncommitted to responding to current and future water risks in the\\ncommunities where we operate. Our global operations network uses\\na Manufacturing Excellence team to recommend best practices in our\\noperational routines, equipment and technologies. This allows us to\\nshare learnings across our global organization and adapt quickly. We\\nidentified Mexico as an extremely high water-stress region that needs\\nstrong focus. In the previous decade, our Mexico team has already\\nexecuted on the easier opportunities to reduce water use intensity.  \\nIn 2024, our Mexico operation had flat progress to our 2019 baseline.\\nThis represents a 2% increase in water consumption compared to the\\nprevious year. Early in the year, there were some operational issues\\nwhich led to higher water use that was later resolved. In 2024, we\\ncompleted an anaerobic wastewater treatment project at our\\nSan Juan del Rio plant that will enable more water recovery for\\ncooling starting 2025.  \\n**39**  \\n**Reducing Waste Across Our Operations**  \\nIn 2024, we continued to work across our global operations to drive\\navoidance of waste to landfill.  \\nAt our North Kansas City plant,\\nwe made improvements to\\nthe manufacturing and\\nwastewater processes\\nthat reduced the  \\namount of liquid waste\\nand solid waste going\\nto landfill. This project\\nwas achieved through\\nmulti-functional  \\ncollaboration, resulting\\nin a 75% reduction in\\nsolid waste to landfill\\nversus 2019 base year.  \\n**40**  \\n**Committed to Minimizing Plastic**\\n**Waste in Our Operations**  \\nIngredion performed a preliminary mapping of where plastics are used within\\nour operations. Primary plastics usage occurs in packaging and shipping/\\ndistribution of product to the customer. Smaller amounts of plastics are used\\nin direct operations, but primarily for quality control, testing of product and\\nintermediate storage. Our estimates indicated that approximately 13,500 MT\\nof plastic packaging material usage containing 50% plastic (as a percentage\\nof total weight) or greater was used in our global operation. We do not have\\ncomplete data on the plastics packaging content associated with our raw\\nmaterial consumption at the present time.  \\nWe aim to reduce plastic waste associated with our operation by completing\\nthree projects per country where we have manufacturing operations. Through\\n2024, we have completed 32 projects. In 2024, our corporate headquarters in\\nWestchester, Illinois, eliminated the use of plastic water bottles in the facility,\\nreplacing them with filtered water and ice machines and water pitchers for\\nmeetings. These simple changes are estimated to reduce 150 kg of plastic.  \\n**Improving Water Quality through**\\n**COD Reduction**  \\nIn waste reduction, we measure the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand)\\nintensity associated with operational streams going to wastewater. Our goal is\\nto reduce our COD intensity by 10% by 2030 compared to our 2019 baseline,\\nso we create more products and less waste from the agriculture crops we\\nconsume. In 2024, we achieved a 1% increase in COD intensity versus our\\n2019 baseline, which was flat compared to 2023 performance. Some of our\\nfacilities were impacted by unexpected operational upsets, which adversely\\nimpacted the global COD intensity.  \\nSeveral of our plant operations teams have formed small working teams to improve this\\nsustainability metric. For example, in our Cali, Colombia, plant, the team initially focused\\non creating standard measurement operating procedures, improving instrumentation\\nand quantifying the major sources of COD. Individual departments then worked to\\nimprove operations in their areas, resulting in a 42% reduction versus 2019 baseline.  \\n**Engaging Our Communities**\\n**on Earth Day**  \\nIn April, several Ingredion sites celebrated\\nSustainability Month with the theme\\n“Global Goals. Local Impact.” Employees\\nacross several sites participated in\\ncommunity activities such as tree\\nplanting, trash pickups and local student\\nenvironmental education.  \\n**41**  \\n**Biodiversity Protection**  \\n##### Continuing our work toward a net-positive biodiversity impact  \\n**Navigating Complexity**\\n**Around Biodiversity**  \\nAs we progress our sustainability program toward our 2030 goals,\\nbiodiversity is an area that continues to present challenges we must\\nfind a way to overcome. The primary drivers for this are:  \\nWhile we have not identified significant biodiversity impacts in our\\nsupply chain, we see value in working with our growers to promote\\nbetter on-farm and ecosystem resiliency.  \\nTo help clarify our path forward, in 2024 we focused on continued\\ndialogue with customers and stakeholders, evaluating tools for\\nbiodiversity assessment, working to evaluate key performance\\nindicators (KPIs) that would help us measure biodiversity impact\\nand alignment with our own regenerative agriculture efforts to\\nbetter leverage interaction with the growers in our supply chain.  \\nTo that last point, we are pleased to report that the Sustainable\\nAgriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform launched its Regenerating\\nTogether program in October of 2024. This will be an important\\nstep forward in helping us align our efforts. To read more about our\\nregenerative agriculture efforts, please see the _Sustainable and_\\n_Regenerative Agriculture_ section of this report.  \\n**42**  \\n**Refining Our View of Biodiversity**  \\nIn 2023, we used the World Wildlife Fund Biodiversity Risk Filter to\\nevaluate the geographies around the world in which we operate. In\\n2024, our focus was on enhancing the information we have about those\\ngeographies to better understand how our operations are, or can, impact\\nthe local ecosystem in a positive way. These enhancements fall into three\\nmajor categories: sustainable and regenerative agriculture, water and\\nengagement.  \\nWe also worked to map out this additional context alongside\\ngeographic biodiversity risk. This work has brought additional\\ninsight to priority areas of focus for biodiversity and\\necosystem services.  \\n**Continuing to Evolve Our Efforts**  \\nGoing forward, our challenge will be finding a way to evaluate biodiversity\\nvalue alongside other environmental factors, such as carbon emissions and\\nwater. We understand there can be trade-offs between these factors. One\\napproach we are evaluating is to quantify the economic value of natural capital\\nwithin a geographic ecosystem to better be able to evaluate interventions and\\nother projects. As an example, the economic value of water in a high-stress\\ngeography could be much higher than the economic value of water in\\na low-stress geography.  \\nEstimating this economic value of biodiversity, carbon and\\nwater could provide us with a more robust mechanism for\\nevaluating intervention approaches, understanding how\\nto prioritize trade-offs and better represent the ecosystem\\nneeds in decision making. This approach could also\\nsuggest KPIs that help us better understand how we\\nare driving progress.  \\nIngredion continues to evaluate partners and opportunities\\nto pilot this economic valuation approach in our supply\\nareas, as we feel it could further strengthen our approach\\naround biodiversity, as well as help inform our sustainable\\nand regenerative agriculture strategy.  \\n*SAI PLATFORM FARM SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT  \\n**43**  \\n**Zero Deforestation**  \\nIn 2024, we continued our process of evaluating our Tier 1 priority crops (corn, tapioca, potato,\\nstevia, pulses) by using the SAI Platform Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA). The FSA\\ncontains questions which are labeled as “Essential,” meaning farms must comply with 100% of\\nthese criteria to be considered sustainable. These include topics such as child labor, forced labor\\nand using licensed pesticides. Included among the 23 Essential questions is one related to no\\ndeforestation on the farm since 2015 (FSA63).  \\nCompleting the FSA with our growers, which includes both a\\nself-assessment by the farmer and a third-party validation audit,\\nis the primary mechanism through which Ingredion assesses\\ndeforestation in our agricultural supply. Being at 85% sustainably\\nsourced means that we have validated that percentage of our\\nsupply chain as having no deforestation.  \\nWhile the European Union Deforestation Regulation does\\nnot apply to Ingredion operations, Ingredion is using the SAI\\nPlatform’s FSA to support our customers and supply chain\\npartners in evaluating deforestation risks in our mutual supply\\nchains. The SAI Platform has already indicated that it is working\\nto keep the FSA relevant to European regulations, with a new\\nmodule being developed in 2024 to align with the requirement\\nof the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.  \\n**44**  \\n**Connected Life**  \\n**45**  \\n**Sustainable and Regenerative Agriculture**  \\n##### Building a climate- resilient agricultural supply chain  \\n**Further Progress on**\\n**Sustainable Sourcing**  \\nWe continued to see progress on our sustainable sourcing program, increasing to 85% sustainably sourced\\nacross our globally sourced Tier 1 crops. Our Tier 1 crops — corn, tapioca, potato, stevia and peas/pulses —\\ncomprise approximately 99% of our global sourcing by volume. Notable increases in sustainable volumes in\\n2024 were seen in the United States, Canada, Thailand and Colombia, driving much of our progress.  \\n**46**  \\nAs we move into 2025, we\\nwill continue to press on\\ntoward 100% sustainable\\nsourcing of our Tier 1\\npriority crops. We know\\nthat there will be challenges\\nin reaching this target –\\ngeopolitical pressures,\\ngrowing small holders in our\\nsupply chain, rising program\\ncosts – but we are dedicated  \\nto driving progress.  \\n**47**  \\n**Enhanced Data Governance** **Regenerative Agriculture Progress**  \\nIn 2024 we implemented digital solutions to help us maintain robust\\ngovernance over the grower data we collect around sustainable and\\nregenerative agriculture. These solutions help us manage information and\\ncosts associated with our program by allowing our local agriculture teams\\nto have a platform through which to communicate this information.  \\nRegenerative agriculture continues to be a focus for Ingredion, and the food and beverage\\nindustry in general. In 2024 we engaged with multiple customers and supply chain partners\\non projects in the United States, Mexico and Brazil as we continue to do preparatory work in\\nother geographies to continue to expand and grow our efforts. Our planning work was focused\\non implementing programs on around 82,000 acres, however, due to changing customer\\nrequirements, farmer implementation delays and other factors, we only implemented\\nregenerative practices on 74,000 acres. Though this falls short of our aspiration for the year,\\nthe time spent in planning activity has laid the foundation for us to continue to drive progress\\nin 2025 and beyond.  \\nSustainable Sourcing In addition to the planning **ANDY**\\nAnalyst work conducted in 2024, **UTTERBACK**  \\nIn addition to the planning\\nwork conducted in 2024,\\nthere were changes in\\nindustry regenerative\\nagriculture standards that\\nwill help drive progress in\\nthe future. In October, the\\nSAI Platform released their  \\nlong-awaited Regenerating\\nTogether regenerative\\nagriculture standard.  \\n**48**  \\n**Gum Acacia Sourcing**  \\nOver the past year, we have engaged with some of our customers regarding our gum acacia\\nsourcing, with concerns arising primarily from political unrest in Sudan. Ingredion sources\\nhigh-quality gum acacia from Sudan, Chad and parts of the Sahel region directly from our\\napproved supplier located along a region known as the “Acacia Belt” that stretches from the\\nRed Sea to the Atlantic. We have a long-established history of sourcing from this area with\\nlocal teams and communities for over 20 years. We are committed to conducting business\\nin accordance with our values, our policies and the law, and we expect our employees and\\nsuppliers to adhere to Ingredion’s Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. We further\\nwork to make certain transactions are fully legitimate, transparent and in accordance with\\nUS trade policies and requirements.  \\nTo maintain full visibility of our sourcing, we use a **three-tiered approach:**  \\nWe encourage and support communities to harvest gum acacia\\nsustainably, based on the age of the trees, environmental factors and\\nuse the least invasive practices to preserve the health and sustainability\\nof the trees. We hire local consultants and experts in the field of\\nacacia forests and gum collection to support our efforts on safety,\\nsustainability and traceability. Our consultants are on sites daily to\\nobserve and document practices, and any concerns identified are\\ncommunicated immediately to Ingredion’s resident representative.  \\nWe continue to monitor potential impacts\\nto our sourcing globally and take action as\\nnecessary in support of ethical, transparent\\nand sustainable sourcing.  \\n**49**  \\n**Food Security**  \\n##### Helping to promote a more food secure world  \\n**Maintaining Our Focus**\\n**on Food Security**  \\nFood security remains an important focus for Ingredion, both in terms of how we operate our business, as well\\nas how we engage with the communities in which we operate. The three focus areas of our food security plan –\\nproduct innovation, small holder farmer engagement and reducing food waste – help support our business in a\\nvariety of ways. Producing innovative ingredient solutions helps our customers increase affordability, formulate\\nnutritious products and embrace texture technology that makes healthy food taste better. Supporting small\\nholder farmers in our supply chain helps increase yields and build stronger climate resiliency into our supply\\nchain. And reducing food waste helps us reduce loss and shrink our environmental footprint.  \\n**Innovating Products in**\\n**Support of Food Security**  \\nWe continue to leverage our expertise in\\ninnovation to help promote sustainable\\nformulations that help promote food security.\\nWe do this by making ingredients that give our\\ncustomers options with plant-based proteins,\\naffordability and upcycled ingredients.  \\nTake our plant-based proteins progress for\\ninstance. We are helping our customers\\nmeet the growing consumer demand for\\nproducts higher in protein without sacrificing\\ncommitment to sustainability and affordability.  \\nAs a demonstration of the value plant proteins can\\nbring to our customers, Ingredion culinologists created\\nan alternative formulation for a cheese cracker snack.  \\nBy replacing whey protein with our VITESSENCE [®]\\nPulse 1853 Pea Protein Isolate, we were able to create\\na snack alternative that reduced blue water usage\\nby 6%, reduced our carbon footprint by 47% and\\nincreased consumer preference for the product by 5%\\nat an equivalent price point. It was a win at every level.\\nHelping our customers navigate the complexity of\\nformulating with plant-based proteins is a step toward\\npromoting the broad adoption of plant proteins needed\\nto help bring food security to a growing population.  \\n**50**  \\nAs we have previously reported, plant protein products like our PRECISA\\nBake 100 can replace up to 50% of eggs in products like muffins, and\\nour VITESSENCE Pulse 3600 can reduce up to 100% of eggs in dry pasta\\napplications. These innovative ingredients can help our customers control\\ncosts to keep their products affordable for the end consumer.  \\nWe also see growing consumer interest in sustainability areas\\nlike regenerative agriculture and upcycled ingredients. Ingredion\\ncontinues to create upcycled ingredients from “ugly” fruit, potato\\nco-streams from French fries and chips and waste citrus peels. Our\\nKerr Concentrates team has over 50 products certified through the\\nUpcycled Food Association, and we are exploring this certification\\nfor other products as well. In addition to turning byproducts or\\nwaste streams into value-added ingredients, there is also the\\npotential for generating products with a lower carbon footprint\\nthat helps our customers meet their own sustainability goals.  \\n**Leveraging Our Knowledge in Support**\\n**of Small Holder Farmers**  \\nAs we have shared in the past, Ingredion is a member of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative\\n(SAI) Platform and uses their Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) to evaluate the growers\\nin our supply chain. Using the FSA allows us to assess areas where growers can be more\\nsustainable, and we leverage these gap assessments to find common areas where we can\\nhelp bring improvement. Nowhere is this more important than the geographies where we\\nwork with small holder farmers.  \\nCurrently, Ingredion’s local\\nagricultural teams are engaged\\nwith small holder farmers in  \\n100% of the geographies from\\nwhich we source our Tier 1  \\npriority crops – corn, tapioca,\\npotato, stevia and peas/pulses.\\nFor more information on  \\nIngredion’s collaboration with\\nour growers across the globe,\\nplease see the _Sustainable_\\n_and Regenerative Agriculture_\\nsection of this report.  \\n**Working to Reduce Food Waste** **Engaging in the SIDEAID**\\n**Across Our Supply Chain** **Project in Europe**  \\nWe continue to refine our methodology for how we look at food waste in our operations.\\nWe have evaluated using our first pass compliance as an indicator of where there might be\\nopportunities to reduce waste in our operations, but this data does not tell the full picture,\\nas off-spec products are often reworked into usable products. We are also looking at the food\\nwaste criteria used by some of our customers, but these guidelines do not seem to account for\\nhow our co-products are used back into the food system. We will continue to evaluate standards\\naround food waste to develop the best programs possible to drive improvement.  \\n**Ingredion Mexico Commits**\\n**to Food Waste Reduction**  \\nIn April 2024, the SIDEAID project was launched with the aim of\\ndeveloping an AI-based decision support framework for side stream\\nvalorization of products in the food industry. Sponsored by the Dutch\\ngovernment as a public-private partnership, the initiative will focus on\\nreducing waste by driving operations toward a more circular economy\\napproach. Ingredion is proud to be collaborating in the SIDEAID\\nproject, eager to engage in ways to use technology and innovation\\nto reduce food waste by better identifying higher value outlets.  \\nIn October 2024, Ingredion Mexico\\nreaffirmed its strategic alliance with the\\nMexican Banco de Alimentos by joining\\nthe Pacto por la Comida initiative,\\nwhich aims at reducing food loss\\nacross the country. The Mexican Banco\\nde Alimentos calls this pact the first\\nvoluntary agreement implemented in\\nLatin America that seeks to unite foodproducing companies in an effort to\\nprevent or reduce food waste. The efforts\\nof the program are well aligned with\\nthe frameworks of the United Nations  \\nSustainable Development Goals of\\nresponsible production and consumption\\n(SDG 12.3) and zero hunger (SDG 2).  \\n**52**  \\n**Community Impact**  \\n##### Creating a positive impact in our communities  \\n**A New Structure to Foster**\\n**Community Engagement and Impact**  \\nIngredion has a long history of supporting the communities in which we operate. As we were developing\\nour All Life plan, we realized there was an opportunity to streamline our focus and drive actions that would\\nhelp deliver meaningful change in our communities while speaking to who Ingredion is as a brand. In 2024,\\nwe further refined our efforts by making a slight shift in our focus to three areas that are aligned with\\nour business – Food Security, STEM Education and Health. We did this in an effort to maximize the impact\\nwe can have both locally and globally.  \\nAt Ingredion, we are committed to strengthening our community impact strategy, which is deeply aligned\\nwith our All Life plan and our overarching company purpose to _make life better_ . Volunteering and\\nphilanthropy in support of the communities in which we operate aligns seamlessly with our company value\\nto Care First, delivering impact that directly enhances individuals’ everyday lives and fosters sustainable\\nconnections with our neighbors.  \\n**53**  \\nBy refining our community impact strategy, we can elevate our work,\\nalign with other focus areas of our All Life plan and create more impactful\\npartnerships. Our employees don’t just work in these communities – they\\nare residents, neighbors and friends who have deep and long-lasting ties\\nto these places. We are determined to help them grow and thrive.  \\n**Supporting Global Food Security**  \\nHunger is the most extreme form of poverty, where people lack the means or access to the\\nfood needed to properly sustain life. According to a 2024 report of the United Nations Food\\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO), 733 million people face hunger every day and around 2.33\\nbillion individuals – nearly 29% of the world’s population – are food insecure without regular\\naccess to nutritious food. That’s why so many of Ingredion’s efforts to promote food security\\nstart with combating hunger. We have a long history of effort to help combat hunger in our\\ncommunities. We continue to collaborate with organizations, such as Feeding America and The\\nGlobal Foodbanking Network, as well as working with various non-government organizations\\n(NGOs) across our global communities.  \\n**54**  \\n**Ingredion Innovation Center**\\n**and Grow-A-Row**  \\nEmployees from our Innovation Center in Bridgewater, USA,\\ncontinued to collaborate with Grow-A-Row, an organization\\nthat grows fresh fruits and vegetables for New Jersey and\\nPennsylvania food banks. In the fall of 2024, approximately\\n85 employees came together on two separate occasions to\\nharvest crops. At a second event,\\nemployees harvested 2,000\\npounds of potatoes to\\nprovide 28,000 servings\\nfor food banks serving\\nthe local community.  \\n#### **228K**  \\n**55**  \\n**Supporting STEM Education**\\n**with Young People**  \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to show an impact on student Science,\\nTechnology, Engineering and Math (STEM) performance, highlighting a critical\\nneed to support student STEM learning. As an innovation company that relies on\\nSTEM talent, Ingredion is not only well positioned to support education in this\\nspace, we have a vested interest in maintaining a healthy STEM pipeline.  \\n**Ingredion Employees Visit with Girls Inc.**  \\nIngredion has partnered with Girls Inc. to support their program of helping\\ninspire, educate and mentor young women. Girls Inc.’s mission is to inspire\\ngirls to be strong, smart and bold by providing them with the knowledge, skills\\nand opportunities to become future leaders. Ingredion was pleased to have\\nsome of our talented female leaders spend time with a team of young ladies\\nand teach them about the jobs they do with the company and how\\nthey reached those positions.  \\nIn April, our Innovation team out of Bridgewater also hosted a Bring Your\\nChild to Work day. During this day, the local team setup seven interactive\\nworkstations with demonstrations to engage the children. All of this was\\nto help share what Ingredion does and help build interest in STEM careers.  \\n**56**  \\n**Governance**'), Document(metadata={'Header 1': '**COMMITTING** **TO THE HIGHEST** **STANDARDS**'}, page_content='**57**  \\n**GOVERNANCE**  \\n##### Maintaining robust programs for ethical business operations  \\n**EcoVadis**  \\nAt the end of 2024, Ingredion submitted our most\\nrecent EcoVadis assessment through their online\\nplatform, receiving a score of 55. While this is an\\nincrease from the previous year, due to shifting criteria\\nat EcoVadis this score no longer reaches the Bronze\\nlevel. We will continue to have a downgrade to our\\nglobal scoring for some time due to the issue at our\\nIndianapolis facility that has since been addressed.  \\nAlthough our score exceeded the numeric threshold\\nsome of our customers have set for their suppliers,\\nwe understand that other customers have set a target\\nof suppliers being at the Silver level. We are working\\nthrough 2025 to implement further enhancements to\\nour processes to help meet those expectations. We will\\ncontinue to have a downgrade to our global scoring\\nfor some time, due to an air permit violation at our\\nIndianapolis, USA, facility, which has been addressed.  \\nTo better demonstrate our efforts with EcoVadis, we\\nwanted to highlight the individual scores of a few of\\nour facilities. This year, we are proud to announce that\\nour Mogi Guaçu, Brazil, facility received a Silver medal\\nwith a score of 70, and our San Juan del Rio, Mexico,\\nplant had a score of 61.  \\n**58**  \\n**Enhancing Our Customer** **Sustainability Governance**\\n**Response Processes** **and Oversight**  \\nSustainability at Ingredion continues to be governed by three main\\nentities. Our Global Sustainability Council, which consists of senior\\nfunctional and regional leaders across our business, helps oversee\\nday-to-day sustainability activity to make certain we are aligned\\nagainst short-term targets in our All Life plan. Sitting over that council\\nis our ESG Executive Advisory Committee, which is made up of select\\nmembers of our executive team, as well as senior leaders with direct\\noversight for sustainability and ESG reporting. This committee is\\ndesigned to make decisions around the functional direction of our\\nsustainability program, with a view to longer-term activities and how\\nthey impact the company and our customers. And finally, the highest\\nlevel of governance lies with Ingredion’s Board of Directors. The\\nboard and its subcommittees oversee high-level sustainability activity,\\nopportunities and risks by providing input and guidance in shaping\\nour strategy.  \\nThese three groups have overlapping members and work closely\\ntogether to make certain Ingredion remains focused on our\\nsustainability initiatives, as well as making sure those initiatives\\nremain relevant to the company and our stakeholders.  \\nIn 2024, we also established a sustainability reporting steering\\ncommittee to provide guidance and oversight on regulatory reporting\\nrequirements like CSRD. This group is comprised mostly\\nof a subset of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\\n(CSRD) and is currently meeting on a more frequent basis to provide\\nmore timely guidance.  \\nIn 2024, we launched a collaboration\\nwith software company Sunhat in\\nan effort to streamline our customer\\nsustainability request responses\\nand provide better standardization\\nof those responses by our global\\nsustainability personnel. Sunhat\\nprovides us with a platform that acts\\nlike a repository for sustainability\\ninformation, data and responses.\\nIt further leverages AI to provide\\nsuggested responses based on\\nprevious answers to customers.  \\n**59**  \\n**Governance, Ethics**\\n**and Compliance**  \\nIngredion’s Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance\\nPrinciples, which are designed to promote the effective functioning\\nof the Board’s activities, to ensure that we conduct our business in\\naccordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. Ingredion’s\\nCorporate Governance Principles ensure that strong, independent\\nDirectors continue to effectively oversee company management and\\nprovide vigorous oversight of how we address key issues relating to\\nstrategy, risk and integrity.  \\nThe Board’s three standing committees—the Audit Committee, the\\nPeople, Culture and Compensation Committee, and the Corporate\\nGovernance and Nominating Committee—each operates pursuant to a\\nwritten charter adopted by the Board. Each committee provides regular\\nreports to the full Board on risk assessment and risk management\\nmatters within its respective scope.  \\nAUDIT COMMITTEE  \\nOur Audit Committee comprises “independent directors,” as\\ndefined under the rules of the NYSE. Consistent with the corporate\\ngovernance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, the Audit\\nCommittee of the Board has primary responsibility for oversight\\nof the company’s risk management profile and its compliance with\\nlegal and regulatory requirements.  \\nPEOPLE, CULTURE AND\\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE  \\nThe People, Culture and Compensation Committee oversees\\nhuman resource and labor matters as well as executive and  \\ndirector compensation issues and considers whether the\\ncompany’s compensation plans, policies and practices encourage\\nexcessive or inappropriate risk taking that could have a material\\nadverse effect on the company.  \\nGOVERNANCE AND\\nNOMINATING COMMITTEE  \\nPursuant to its Charter, the Corporate Governance and Nominating\\nCommittee addresses potential risks that could result from the\\nabsence of independence or diversity on the Board, potential\\nconflicts of interest, ethics and compliance, environmental and\\nquality matters, and security and safety issues.  \\nAt the Board level, the Governance and Nominating Committee\\nprovides oversight of our corporate governance practices and\\nBusiness Integrity Program. Senior level management provide\\noversight for significant strategies and program effectiveness\\nthrough regular meetings and communications.  \\n**60**  \\n**Linking Sustainability to**\\n**Executive Compensation**  \\nThis year, we also made progress on our efforts to link executive compensation to our\\nsustainability performance. Our executive leadership team now has direct measurements tied\\nto the company performance in safety, carbon emissions reductions and sustainable sourcing\\nprogress. While Ingredion employees have had a long-standing link in compensation to safety\\nperformance, this marks a further evolution in aligning with some of the key targets in our\\nAll Life plan.  \\n**Business Integrity Program**  \\nIngredion’s ethics and compliance program is called “Business Integrity” because our values\\ncenter on integrity: trust and integrity are the essential ingredients to our program. Our Business\\nIntegrity program is robust and comprehensive, designed to support employees’ understanding\\nof legal requirements and operating our business responsibly, ethically and with integrity.  \\nWe operationalize our\\nBusiness Integrity  \\ngovernance, risk\\nand culture.  \\nThe Business Integrity program supports\\nour values-based culture in all our\\noperations, building high performance\\nwith integrity and helping our employees\\nmanage risk with confidence. We do this by:  \\n- Providing advice, training and raising awareness among Ingredion\\nemployees on integrity and compliance-related topics.  \\n- Establishing risk-based due diligence processes in relation to new\\nand existing counter-parties.  \\n- Collaborating with and supporting other Ingredion functions to\\nensure the organization’s requirements on ethics, integrity, anticorruption and other risk issues are appropriately implemented.  \\n- Receiving and investigating reports on integrity violations and\\nnon-compliance.  \\n- Developing policies, procedures, job aids that provide guidance on\\nbusiness practice risks, integrity and ethics.  \\n- Performing risk assessments and developing appropriate\\nremediation plans.  \\n- Delivering on operational priorities that the Business Integrity\\nteam deems appropriate to support the program’s objective to\\ndeliver a robust, risk-based compliance and ethics program that\\nwill inform, engage and inspire our employees deliver high\\nperformance with integrity.  \\n**61**  \\n**Executive Business Integrity** Governance Highlights:\\n**and Segment Committees** Core Policies and Training  \\nTo facilitate the effective operation of the Business Integrity Program, Ingredion has\\nestablished a center-led program of compliance policies, standards and procedures.\\nThe Integrity Program is led at the corporate level by the Executive Business Integrity\\nCommittee (EBIC). The EBIC and Business Segment Committees oversee the integration\\nof the program in each geography in which the Company operates. Their leadership\\npromotes compliance and ethical business practices and fosters our Speak Up! culture,\\nso that suspected violations of law and policy are promptly reviewed and investigated.\\nBusiness Integrity’s procedures include certifications of compliance, audits, seminars or\\nsuch other programs as appropriate for a specific risk issue.  \\n**62**  \\n**Training and**\\n**Communication**  \\nThroughout the year, we provide consistent and interactive training to\\nour global teams to create a steady drumbeat of communication on the\\nimportance of ethical business practices.  \\nOur annual Living Our Values training also includes an annual certification of\\ncompliance, conflicts of interest disclosure and now, for the third year in a\\nrow, an ethical culture pulse survey. Other communication examples include:  \\n**01** **02** **03**  \\n**63**  \\n**Ethisphere World’s** **Business Ethics Reporting**\\n**Most Ethical Companies**\\nOur _Speak Up!_ culture encourages employees and suppliers to raise\\nconcerns and report suspected misconduct.  \\n**Business Ethics Reporting**  \\nIngredion’s leadership in sustainability, governance, ethics and\\ncompliance in 2024 led to it being honored for the eleventh time as one\\nof the World’s Most Ethical Companies [©] by Ethisphere Institute for 2025.  \\nIngredion’s Business Integrity program\\nwas also featured in Ethisphere’s\\n“Ethicast” Webcast, showcasing the\\ncompany’s approach to monitoring\\nand measuring the effectiveness of\\nour internal investigations.  \\nThe Business Ethics Line is available 24/7, is available in 12 languages and\\noffers the option for anonymous reporting. The Business Ethics Line is\\nmanaged by an independent, third-party vendor and is freely available\\nto employees and anyone who conducts business with Ingredion. Our\\nreporting process logs, reviews and assigns reported matters to trained\\ninternal team members. For quality assurance, Ingredion annually reviews\\nthe effectiveness of its internal reporting process and solicits feedback\\nfrom individuals who, if identified, have interacted with the process to\\nensure compliance with our investigative principles of procedural justice.\\nIngredion investigates all credible good-faith reports of misconduct.\\nWe have a zero-tolerance for retaliation against anyone who reports\\nsuspected violations of policy in good faith.  \\n**64**  \\nA Letter from Our Chief\\n##### **People: Our Key Ingredient** for Sustainability Sustainability Officer  \\nThank you for taking the time to read our 2024\\nSustainability Report. While I’m very proud of\\nthe progress we continue to make toward our\\nsustainability goals, I’m even more proud of\\nthe level of engagement we continue to see\\nin this critical space.  \\nAs you have read, we continue to leverage the diverse capabilities of our employees\\nand our business partners to drive progress. Our employees continue to find ways to\\ninnovate on sustainable solutions and programs. We leverage stakeholder knowledge\\nand insight by working closely with our customers and NGO partners to collaborate\\nand create mutual value in reaching our sustainability aspirations.  \\nMake no mistake, sustainability continues to be a challenging area where we\\nsee trade-offs, shifting business priorities, increasing regulations and evolving\\nstakeholder demand. Now more than ever it is critical that we maintain open and\\nhonest dialogue with our business partners so we can identify a path forward.\\nAcross 2024 I had many meetings with our customers’ senior leadership teams, and\\nsustainability continues to be an area of focus and growth. I believe there continues\\nto be an emphasis on valuing transparency and collaboration over perfection.  \\nWhen I pause and look back for a moment, I am amazed and proud of how far we\\nhave come. For the first time in 2024, Ingredion was named to Barron’s 100 Most\\nSustainable US Companies list. We are humbled to be included with companies\\nthat we admire and benchmark ourselves against in creating sustainable business.\\nAccomplishments like this happen not because we have a small team of people\\nworking on sustainability, but because the very idea of being a more sustainable\\nbusiness has been embraced by our employees in regions and functions across\\nthe business. I continue to be humbled by how our people innovate to enhance\\nsustainability in their day-to-day jobs.  \\nAs we continue to drive progress, I know we will continue to encounter challenges\\nand business opportunities that require us to adapt our sustainability strategy.\\nThe path forward will be very clear in some areas, while less clear in others. We\\nwill remain focused on moving forward, learning from our mistakes, sharing best\\npractices with our stakeholders and ultimately continuing to drive progress on our\\nsustainability goals. We will continue to do this by leveraging the talent of our\\npeople and the individuals with whom we collaborate.  \\n**65**  \\n**GRI**\\n**Index**  \\nThe Organization and Its Reporting Practices  \\n**NUMBER** **DESCRIPTION** **CROSS-REFERENCE/RESPONSE** **SDG LINK** **ADDITIONAL COMMENTS**  \\n|2-1|Organizational details|Legal Name: Ingredion Incorporated<br>Ownership and legal form: 2024 Annual Report<br>Location of headquarters: Chicago, Illinois (USA)<br>Location of operations: 2024 Annual Report|Col4|Additional information on our locations can be found at www.<br>ingredion.com.|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|2-2|Entities included in the organization’s<br>sustainability reporting|2024 Annual Report|||\\n|2-3|Reporting period, frequency and contact<br>point|Reporting period: 2024 Sustainability Report<br>Frequency: Ingredion’s sustainability reports are<br>issued annually and based on calendar year<br>Contact Point: Inquiries about this GRI Index or<br>Ingredion’s sustainability program can be directed<br>to corpcomm@ingredion.com||Ingredion provides updates on our eforts on an annual basis.|\\n|2-4|Restatements of information|||There were no restatements of information in<br>Ingredion 2024 Sustainability Report.|\\n|2-5|External assurance|2024 CDP Corporate Report,<br>2024 Sustainability Report||Data reported in Ingredion’s 2024 CDP Corporate Report<br>combined questionnaire is verifed by Apex.
